### Project Description
[

findrX is a smart web application designed to help users quickly identify and locate a specific item from a large collection of things. Built using HTML, CSS, and powered by Gemini AI, it can analyze what you capture or input and instantly point out the item you‚Äôre looking for.

With its simple interface and intelligent search capability, findrX turns a time-consuming ‚Äúsearch through everything‚Äù task into a matter of seconds ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs spotting an object in a cluttered space, identifying items from images, or just finding that one thing you really need.
